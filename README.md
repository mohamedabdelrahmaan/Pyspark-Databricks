## Project Goals

This project demonstrates Spark usage on Azure Databricks for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The main objectives are:

1. Data Exploration: Explore a sample dataset using Spark.
2. Data Transformation: Perform data cleaning and transformation operations.
3. Data Visualization: Create insightful visualizations using SQL queries.
4. Dataset Operations: Show how to work with Datasets in Spark.

## Main Steps

1. **DBFS Listing**: Display Databricks File System (DBFS) file listing.

2. **Reading and Counting Lines**: Read and count lines from a file.

3. **DataFrames**: Load data as DataFrames, clean and explore it, and run SQL queries.

4. **Visualization**: Execute SQL queries for data visualization.

5. **Datasets**: Create and explore Datasets, perform SQL operations, save data, and work with Parquet files.
